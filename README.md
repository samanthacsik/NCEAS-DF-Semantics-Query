# NCEAS-DF-Semantics-Query

My first attempts at using Bryce Mecum's `eatocsv` [package](https://github.com/amoeba/eatocsv) and code modified by [Steven Chong](https://github.nceas.ucsb.edu/stevenchong/adc-controlled-voc) to extract attribute information from Arctic Data Center holdings. 

This repo is used to store practice attemps (primarily using a small subset of ADC holdings) and to figure out an effective file structure. 

For more formal analyses and progress on my semantics analysis work as a 2020 Data Science Fellow with the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)) and the [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io/), see this [repo](https://github.com/samanthacsik/NCEAS-DF-Semantics-Project).
