"doi:10.18739/A2SX64880","Wetlands are the single largest natural source of atmospheric methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas, and occur extensively in the northern hemisphere. Large discrepancies remain between bottom-up and top-down estimates of northern CH4 emissions. To explore whether these discrepancies are due to poor representation of non-growing season CH4 emissions, we synthesized non-growing season and annual CH4 flux measurements from temperate, boreal, and tundra wetlands and uplands. Median non-growing season wetland emissions ranged from 0.9 g/m² in bogs to 5.2 g/m² in marshes and were dependent on moisture, vegetation, and permafrost. Annual wetland emissions ranged from 0.9 g/m²/y in tundra bogs to 78 g/m²/y in temperate marshes. Uplands varied from CH4 sinks to CH4 sources with a median annual flux of 0.0 ± 0.2 g/m²/y. The measured fraction of annual CH4 emissions during the non-growing season (observed: 13 to 47%) was significantly larger than was predicted by two process-based model ensembles, especially between 40-60º N (modeled: 4 to 17%). Constraining the model ensembles with the measured non-growing fraction increased total non-growing season and annual CH4 emissions. Using this constraint, the modeled non-growing season wetland CH4 flux from > 40° north was 6.1 ± 1.5 Tg/y, three times greater than the non-growing season emissions of the unconstrained model ensemble. The annual wetland CH4 flux was 37 ± 7 Tg/y from the data-constrained model ensemble, 25% larger than the unconstrained ensemble. Considering non-growing season processes is critical for accurately estimating CH4 emissions from high latitude ecosystems, and necessary for constraining the role of wetland emissions in a warming climate. This dataset contains the synthesis of measured flux data from the study.","Growing season, non-growing season and annual methane (CH4) fluxes from temperate, boreal, and Arctic wetlands and uplands (synthesis), 1989-2016","methane alpine/tundra peatlands wetlands"

"doi:10.18739/A28G8FH70","Permafrost thaw exposes previously frozen soil organic matter to microbial decomposition. This process generates methane and carbon dioxide, and thereby fuels a positive feedback process that leads to further warming and thaw. Despite widespread permafrost degradation during the past ~40 years, the degree to which permafrost thaw may be contributing to a feedback between warming and thaw in recent decades is not well understood. Radiocarbon evidence of modern emissions of ancient permafrost carbon is also sparse. Here we combine radiocarbon dating of lake bubble trace-gas methane (113 measurements) and soil organic carbon (289 measurements) for lakes in Alaska, Canada, Sweden and Siberia with numerical modelling of thaw and remote sensing of  thermokarst shore expansion. Methane emissions from thermokarst areas of lakes that have expanded over the past 60 years were directly proportional to the mass of soil carbon inputs to the lakes from the erosion of thawing permafrost. Radiocarbon dating indicates that methane age
from lakes is nearly identical to the age of permafrost soil carbon thawing around them. Based on this evidence of landscape-scale permafrost carbon feedback, we estimate that 0.2 to 2.5 Pg permafrost carbon was released as methane and carbon dioxide in thermokarst expansion zones of pan-Arctic lakes during the past 60 years.","Methane emissions (Alaska, Canada, Sweden, Siberia) proportional to permafrost carbon thawed in Arctic lakes since the 1950s","methane methane emissions thermakarst methane ebullition permafrost pan-arctic lakes lake area change radio carbon dating soil organic carbon"
"doi:10.18739/A2KJ9C","Introduction:   Between 1958 and 1999, Austin Post led the USGS collection of aerial imagery of North American glaciers. These images are primarily vertical stereo black and white images, although single oblique images, as well as color images have been collected. The glaciers of North America were the subjects, and the digital products made available here serve to document the changes that have occurred to the glaciers over the past 5 decades. The purpose of this project is to preserve the data contained within these film images in a digital format for future analysis of North American glacier change.   File Layout:    1.   The first level contains an overall data set of image metadata from 1964 - 1997 (nagapData.csv) and an R script (searchData.R) with instructions on how to search and subset the data.  fileLayout.pdf shows the file structure and folder contents visually.  There are also three kml files with flight path information by decade.   2.   The second level is the year in which the pictures were taken.  There are 32 years with images from 1964 – 1997.  The majority of these folders are jpegs with notes provided by Austin Post.  They also contain a year-specific csv (YYYY.csv) that contains image metadata for the entire year (date, roll numbers, location name, longitude, latitude, altitude, media, and comments).  The overall data set (nagapData.csv) is the aggregate of each individual “YYYY.csv” file.   3.   The glacier photos are located at the third level (this level).  The folders at this level are distinguished by camera roll number (1, 2, etc.), and image type (thumbnail, jpeg, or tif); some also contain fiducial and oblique image folders.  This level primarily contains image files of aerial photos as either thumbnails, jpegs, or tifs. It also includes a csv with image metadata specific to each roll (date, roll numbers, location name, longitude, latitude, altitude, media, and comments), a text file (info.txt) with camera specifications unique to each image, and a text file (histo.txt or matchReport.txt) with color information and scanner specifications unique to each image.","Photogrammetric scans of aerial photographs of North American glaciers, 1977.
